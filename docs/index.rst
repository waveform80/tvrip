========
Welcome!
========

tvrip is a small command line script that brings together several other
utilities (HandBrake, Atomic Parsley, mkvtoolnix, VLC, etc.) with the aim of
making it relatively simple to rip whole seasons or series of TV episodes from
DVD to high quality MP4 or Matroska files, along with optional subtitles,
alternate languages and director's commentaries.


Getting Started
===============

See the :doc:`install` chapter to get started. Most users (including those
already familiar with HandBrake) are encouraged to start with the
:doc:`tutorial` to get an idea of a typical work-flow in the application.
