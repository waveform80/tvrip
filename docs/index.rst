tvrip is a small command line script that brings together several other
utilities (Handbrake, Atomic Parsley, mkvtoolnix, VLC, etc.) with the aim of
making it relatively simple to rip whole seasons or series of TV episodes from
DVD to high quality MP4 or Matroska files, along with optional subtitles,
alternate languages and director's commentaries.
