    episodes [number]

The ``episodes`` command can be used to list the episodes of the currently
selected season of the program. If an argument is given, the current episode
list is deleted and you will be prompted to enter names for the specified
number of episodes.

If you simply wish to change the name of a single episode, see the
:doc:`cmd_episode` command instead.
