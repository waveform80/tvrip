Ripping discs is much more art than science, and there are numerous edge cases
that you may run into. This section tries to cover what to do in some of these
scenarios.


Blu-ray ripping
===============

TBC -- cover configuration steps, and limitations of blu-ray ripping vs dvd


Fixing "combing" artifacts
==========================

TBC -- cover decomb, what it looks like, why you want progressive, when to
check for it, difference between "auto" and "on" decomb settings


Ignoring duplicated titles
==========================

TBC -- cover duplicates setting, when to use it and when not to, and why
duplicate tracks typically exist


Mapping chapter-based episodes
==============================

TBC -- automapping by playback example (try and find an actual example; Robot
Chicken was definitely one)


Multipart episode handling
==========================

TBC -- how kodi (and therefore tvrip) expects these to be named, how
automapping looks for duration multiples


Format selection tips
=====================

TBC -- mp4 vs mkv, aac vs mp3, etc. -- compatibility versus flexibility
